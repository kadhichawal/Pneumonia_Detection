# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Python and the fastai library. The model leverages transfer learning with ResNet50 and is trained on the [Kaggle Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## Features

- End-to-end notebook for data preparation, training, evaluation, and inference
- Uses transfer learning with ResNet50 for high accuracy
- Handles class imbalance with F1 score monitoring
- Includes code to test random images and visualize predictions
- Model export and instructions for deployment


## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
